      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
            With more than 1.3 billion people (one-sixth of the world's total population!), India represents nearly every major
            religion and many ethnic groups within its borders. Its many cuisines reflect that diversity, and biryani is a great
            example. The spiced rice dish made with vegetables or meat is familiar to all Indians and has countless variations
            across the country.
      </p>
      <p>
            Many Indians are vegetarian or vegan for religious or cultural reasons. The predominant religion in India is Hinduism,
            and while it doesn't strictly forbid eating meat, it does promote a lifestyle that respects other forms of life. Others
            eat animal products like milk, eggs, and honey. And there are plenty of people who eat meat, too, so there are many
            different types of biryani.

                  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                  
                  <li>¼ teaspoon ground red chile pepper</li>
                  
                  <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>

                  <li>4 cups water</li>
                  
                  <li>2 cups basmati rice, rinsed and drained</li>
            </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                  <li>
                        Melt ghee in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion, and cook until softened, about 3 minutes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                        Stir in cumin seed, cinnamon stick, and peppercorns; cook until the spices are fragrant, and the cumin seeds begin to
                        pop, about 3 minutes.
                  </li> 
                  <li>
                        Stir in ginger garlic paste, tomatoes, and 1/2 cup water. Bring to a simmer, and cook until the water has evaporated,
                        about 5 minutes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                        Stir in peas, carrot, and potato. Season with chicken bouillon, salt, red chile, black pepper, garam masala, and turmeric. Stir well, then cover, and cook for 3 minutes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                        Pour in 4 cups water and bring to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, stir in basmati rice, reduce heat to medium,
                        recover, and simmer for 10 minutes.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                        Reduce heat to low and continue to cook until the rice has softened, 10 to 15 minutes more.
                  </li>
            </ol>
