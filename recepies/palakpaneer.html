      <h1>Palak Paneer (Indian spinach curry with tofu)</h1>
      <img src="../images/palakpaneer1.jpg" alt="A Palak Paneer Image">
      <h3>Description :</h3>
      <p> Palak paneer is an Indian dish consisting of paneer (a type of cheese) in a thick paste made from puréed spinach, called
      palak in Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and other Indian languages. The terms palak paneer and saag paneer are sometimes used
      interchangeably in restaurants in the Anglosphere.</p>
      <p> However, saag paneer is different from traditional palak paneer in
      that it contains other green leafy vegetables, such as mustard greens, whereas palak paneer only contains spinach</p>
